Boudoir photography business dataset

Goal is to have 3 data driven actionable insights into the Boudoir Phototography Studio.
Since the Business model for Boudoir Photography is divided into 3 parts - The Booking/Pre-shoot consultation,
the actual photoshoot, and the private viewing/Sales Session - insights should target each of those areas.  
  1 Preshoot - This is the primary source of data for the business.  List additional data that is collected
    but perhaps not recorded or could be improved.  A lot of easy data was left on the table. 
  2 The Shoot - the data set included a feature called "Favorite".  By parsing and exploring this feature we can
    deduce what a successful boudoir photograph needs to be proficient at in or to properly servcies clients.
  3 The Sales Session - by analysing correlation between features in the dataset, we might be able
    find the most important aspect for maximizing Total Sales.  

What is the most important feature/variable for maximizing Total Sales?
